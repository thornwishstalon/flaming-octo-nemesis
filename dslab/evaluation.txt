the LoadTest runs stable (~2h) using the following settings

clients = 100
auctionsPerMin = 10
auctionDuration = 120
updateIntervalSec = 10
bidsPerMin = 10

even a slight increase in clients (e.g.: = 120 ) or operations per minute (auctionsPerMin = 20, bidsPerMin = 10) results
in a server-side out-of-memory exception shortly after the start (approximately 2-3 minutes). However, the server 
can still go on with serving the clients after the occurrence of an out-of-memory exception. The creation of new 
auctions is up from this point no longer possible as there is no memory for new threads available.
